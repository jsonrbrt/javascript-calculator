# üßÆ Simple JavaScript Calculator

A basic arithmetic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on implementing robust state management to handle complex user inputs, including chained operations and error handling (division by zero).

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
* **Chained Operations:** Correctly handles continuous calculations (e.g., `8 * 2 * 4` results in `64`).
* **State Management:** Uses dedicated variables (`firstOperand`, `storedOperator`) to maintain calculation state.
* **Clear Functions:** Includes **C** (Clear All) and **CE** (Clear Entry) buttons.
* **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" on division by zero.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure
* **CSS3:** Styling (for basic layout and appearance)
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Core logic and DOM manipulation

## üí° Project Goals (Why This Project?)

This calculator was built as an exercise to master fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

* **Function Routing:** Directing user input to specialized functions (`handleInput`).
* **Global State Management:** Tracking the application's state (operands and operators) outside of function scope.
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `if/else` statements for control flow and operator routing.
